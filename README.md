# led-cube-simulation
little led cube simulation for the browser!
This is a little three.js script that simulates a cube of LED's. It will soon reflect an array that will contain the colour values and status of each LED at x,y,z.

#ToDo
- Add led lighting affect to cubes
- read in the led properties
- sync with the real cube so as to represent it correctly at any given point
